# Ecommerce-with-React

This is a full-featured eCommerce web application built with React that allows users to browse and purchase various types of clothing. The app includes features such as product listing, filtering, cart management, user authentication, and more.

## How it was made

**Tech Stack**:

- React.js – For building the user interface using reusable components.
- React Router (react-router-dom) – For managing client-side routing and navigation between pages like Home, Shop, Cart, and Checkout.
- React Hooks – For managing component state and lifecycle features in a clean and functional way.
- React Redux – For global state management across components, especially for cart and user data.
- Firebase – Used for both authentication and as a NoSQL database to store user data and product information.
- SCSS – For modular and maintainable styling.

This project combines the power of React with state management and real-time backend integration, creating a smooth and responsive eCommerce experience.

## Known Issues

- The application is still in development and not fully feature-complete.
- No payment system is currently integrated.
- The Redux store implementation may not follow the latest best practices and needs refactoring.
- Mobile responsiveness is still a work in progress.

## Lesseons Learned

This was my first major project using React, so I had to quickly get comfortable not only with JSX and component-based architecture but also with the broader ecosystem of tools and best practices.

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Structure a React app with multiple routes and nested components.
- Manage state effectively using both React Hooks and Redux.
- Connect a front-end app to a real-time NoSQL database (Firebase).
- Handle user authentication with Firebase Auth.
- Style components using SCSS in a scalable way.

Working with Firebase also taught me about the pros and cons of NoSQL databases, particularly when it comes to structuring and querying hierarchical data.
